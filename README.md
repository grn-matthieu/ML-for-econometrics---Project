# ML for Econometrics: the effect of gender on labor outcomes

This repository has been done for the course of Machine Learning for Econometrics taught by Bruno Crépon and Matthieu Doutreligne. 
It is a group project done by Matthieu Grenier, Titouan Le Calvé, Eloïse Leroux and Mira Maamari.

We used data about wages in France in 2021 from INSEE (https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7651654#dictionnaire).

Our analysis is done in 4 notebooks:
- 1 - Data imports and preprocessing.ipynb : this file has to be run first, to get the preprocessed data.
- 2 - Exploratory data analysis.ipynb : we explain the setting, explicit the identifying assumptions and provide some descriptive statistics and graphs.
- 3 - Modelling wages.ipynb : we use methods such as Lasso regressions, Ridge regressions and cross-validation to investigate the effect of gender and other covariates on wages.
- 4 - Analysis of extra hours.ipynb : we use Lasso and logistic regressions to investigate the effect of gender and other covariates on overtime work.
